## Profile
Data Scientist (Applied / Production ML) with an end-to-end focus: problem framing, training, evaluation, and deployment (API/batch). Operational monitoring of drift and performance. Emphasis on **reproducibility**, **traceability**, **observability**, and runbook-driven operations.
Availability: open to remote roles.

## Key Impact
- Reproducible, production-ready E2E pipelines: versioned artifacts, batch/API execution, dashboards, and operational documentation.
- Model and data monitoring: drift (PSI/KS), performance, and post-deployment analysis with operational criteria.
- Traceability and operations: MLflow **tracking**, handoffs, runbooks, and checklists; automated testing with pytest.

## Top Projects (3 main + 1 operational)

## Experience
### ML Engineer / Applied Scientist (Production ML Portfolio)
2024 - Present
- Built reproducible pipelines for training, evaluation, and serving (API/batch) with experiment and artifact traceability.
- Implemented drift/performance monitoring and operational documentation (runbooks) for post-deployment support.
- Improved robustness with automated tests (pytest) and standardized handoffs/checklists.

### Operations and Technical Consulting | MacDaniels
2019 - Present
- Handled 2–3 tickets per day across Mac and Windows environments, with ~2-hour average resolution time.
- Structured diagnosis and root-cause analysis; documentation and standardization of procedures.
- Used AI to accelerate diagnosis and responses.
- Improved client communication; high satisfaction with only 1 negative comment due to communication.

## Education and Languages
- Training: continuous learning in applied ML and ML systems (evidence on GitHub).
- Spanish: Native | English: Technical (documentation reading; conference support with real-time translation tools).
